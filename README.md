```

## Configuration

### Theme Customization

The application features a modern orange color palette with dark mode support. Themes are automatically saved to browser localStorage and persist across sessions.

**Color Variables:**
- Light theme: Orange primary (#FF6B35), with complementary oranges
- Dark theme: Warmer orange (#FF7F50) optimized for dark backgrounds

### AI Assistant Setup

To enable AI features:

1. Install Ollama from <https://ollama.ai/>
2. Pull a compatible model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull codellama
   # or
   ollama pull llama2
   ```
3. Start the Ollama service
4. Restart the application - AI features will be automatically detected

### LaTeX Compiler Configuration

The application automatically detects common LaTeX installations. If needed, you can customize the compiler path in `main.py`:

```python
# Update the pdflatex command if needed
subprocess.run(['pdflatex', '-interaction=nonstopmode', f"{filename}.tex"])
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Compilation failed" Error**
   - Check that your LaTeX syntax is correct
   - Ensure LaTeX (MiKTeX/TeX Live) is properly installed
   - Verify that `pdflatex` is accessible from the command line
   - Check the compilation log in the preview panel for detailed errors

2. **Preview Not Showing**
   - Ensure the document compiled successfully (check for error messages)
   - Verify that PyMuPDF is installed correctly: `pip install PyMuPDF`
   - Check that the PDF was generated in the output directory

3. **AI Assistant Not Working**
   - Install Ollama from <https://ollama.ai/>
   - Pull a compatible model: `ollama pull codellama`
   - Ensure the Ollama service is running
   - Check the AI status indicator in the sidebar

4. **Dark Mode Not Saving**
   - Enable cookies/localStorage in your browser
   - Clear browser cache and try again
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

5. **LaTeX Packages Missing**
   - On first use, MiKTeX will prompt to install missing packages
   - Allow automatic package installation in MiKTeX settings
   - For TeX Live, install the full distribution or use `tlmgr install <package>`

6. **Port 5000 Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `main.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`
   - Or kill the process using port 5000

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+S**: Save current file
- **Ctrl+Enter**: Compile LaTeX document
- **Ctrl+Space**: Trigger autocomplete (in editor)
- **Esc**: Close settings menu
